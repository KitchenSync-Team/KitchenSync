# KitchenSync Documentation

This directory collects project-wide documentation as we transition from the starter kit to KitchenSync.

- `reference/nextjs-supabase-starter.md` &mdash; the original Next.js + Supabase quickstart guide for reference while we build out our own docs.
- Future architecture notes, ADRs, and onboarding guides can live alongside the reference folder.

> TODO: replace the reference notes with KitchenSync-specific documentation as flows are implemented.
