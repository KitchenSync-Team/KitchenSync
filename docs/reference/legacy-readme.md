# üßæ KitchenSync ü•´ü•ï  
A smart kitchen management **web application** to reduce food waste and make meal planning easier.  

This document serves as both a **README** and a **living project plan** for our team.  
Everyone should feel free to add, refine, or expand based on their area of focus.

## üìå Problem
Food waste is expensive, unsustainable, and preventable. Many households:
- Forget what food they already have  
- Let groceries expire before being used  
- Struggle to plan meals around what‚Äôs on hand  

**KitchenSync** addresses these challenges by helping users better visualize their kitchen, track what they own, and make smarter use of their food before it goes to waste.  

---

## üóÇÔ∏è App Overview
KitchenSync organizes your kitchen into simple, intuitive sections for easy management:
- **Fridge** ‚Äì perishable items that expire quickly  
- **Freezer** ‚Äì long-term frozen goods  
- **Pantry** ‚Äì shelf-stable items  
- **Spice Rack** ‚Äì long-lasting flavor essentials  

Each section ties into the app‚Äôs smart systems for expiration tracking, recommendations, and notifications.

## üöÄ Core Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Receipt / Barcode Scanning
- Quickly add items via barcode lookup or receipt upload.  
- **Fallback:** Manual entry when an item isn‚Äôt recognized.  
- Uses external APIs for product metadata (e.g., OpenFoodFacts).  

> **Developer Note (Brendan):**  
> In a previous project, I built a Python scraper that collected candidate data from Ohio Board of Elections websites. When only PDFs were available, I successfully used **OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT API** for **vision-based OCR extraction**, which reliably returned structured JSON data.  
> This method could be explored as a potential OCR solution for KitchenSync, pending instructor approval.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Expiration Management
- Prompts users to add expiration dates during item entry or scan.  
- Expiration tracking is **optional**, but when added:
  - A reminder is sent **5 days before** an item expires.  
  - A follow-up alert is sent **on the expiration date** prompting deletion or confirmation.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lifestyle & Preferences Quiz
- Optional onboarding quiz to learn user tastes, dietary preferences, and cooking habits.  
- Inspired by Netflix‚Äôs ‚Äúfavorite shows‚Äù onboarding.  
- Helps **personalize recipe recommendations** and jump-start user engagement.  

---

## üß† Stretch Goals
If time and resources allow:
- **AI Integration:** Generate recipe suggestions, meal plans, and predictive shopping lists.  
- **Social Features:** Following chefs/creators, liking or sharing recipes, and profile pages.  
- **Mobile App:** Native version after web platform stabilization.

## üí° Solution Approach

| **Phase** | **Goal** | **Core Deliverables** |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Phase 1 ‚Äì MVP** | Core functionality | Manual entry, barcode scanning, expiration tracking |
| **Phase 2 ‚Äì Smart Management** | Automation | Receipt OCR integration, lifestyle quiz, recipe linkage |
| **Phase 3 ‚Äì Expansion** | Intelligence & reach | AI recipe recommendations, social layer, mobile app |

---

## üß± Architecture & Tech Stack (Tentative)

**Frontend:** React (Web-first)  
**Backend:** Node.js / Express or Firebase  
**Database:** Firestore, PostgreSQL, or similar (to be finalized by Prashansa)  
**OCR / AI:** OpenAI Vision API or Tesseract.js (pending approval)  
**Recipe Dataset:** [Food.com Recipes & Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews)  
**Product Metadata:** [OpenFoodFacts API](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/)  

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical & Legal Considerations
- **Privacy:** Secure handling of user data (receipts, preferences, inventory).  
- **Licensing:** Compliance with open data and API usage terms.  
- **Food Safety:** Expiration tracking provides guidance, not guarantees.  
- **Transparency:** Distinguish curated vs. AI-generated content.
